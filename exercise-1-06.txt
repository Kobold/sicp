When Alyssa attempts to use new-if to compute square roots, the
interpreter will enter an infinite recursion and won't return a value.
This is because new-if is strictly evaluated unlike the special form
if. Even though (good-enough? guess x) is eventually true the
(sqrt-iter ...) alternative to new-if will still be evaluated, and this
will continue until the interpreter blows up.
